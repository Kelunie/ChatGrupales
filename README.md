## Guide to Setting up the Project in XAMPP

1. Download or copy the project into your XAMPP project folder or any other PHP server you are using.
2. Create a new folder named img to store all the background images, logos, and other assets you need.
3. In the menu.inc file, change the line img src="codes/img/logo.png" to the path of the logo you want to use.
4. For the database connection, open the conexion.inc file and update the variables with your database configuration details.
5. In the BD folder, the query.txt file contains the SQL queries for creating the database. Please execute them in the order provided (top to bottom).
6. To create Technical Support (TI) users, navigate to localhost/ChatGrupales/crear_tecnico.php in your web browser and create a new user. Note that creating users directly through the database dashboard will not work.
7. Ensure your operating system recognizes the directory paths correctly. Depending on your OS, paths may be formatted as something/else, something//else, or something\else.
8. Most of the code is commented in Spanish; you can use Google Translate to translate comments if needed.
